/**
 * Security response header behaviour.
 *
 * These tests pin two properties that were only observable once the application
 * was deployed behind a real reverse proxy over HTTPS.
 *
 * The first is HSTS duplication. Both nginx and the application asserted
 * Strict-Transport-Security, so every response on the live site carried two
 * identical copies. Browsers do not agree on how to handle duplicate HSTS
 * headers, and an ambiguous security header is a poor kind of security header.
 * The rule is now: the application asserts it only when nothing is in front of
 * it, detected by the absence of X-Forwarded-Proto.
 *
 * The second is that the CSP must never acquire an unsafe source. That is
 * asserted by the live suite too, but pinning it here means a regression fails
 * the build rather than waiting for a deployment.
